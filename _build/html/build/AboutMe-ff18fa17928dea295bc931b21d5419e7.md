title: About Me
---

Hi I'm Dan, a data analyst with a background in computational chemistry and 3 years' experience in the financial services industry. During this time I have worked on many different data projects, varying from ETL and dashboard reporting to machine learning and statistical analysis, giving me a good understanding of the whole data pipeline.

This website serves as a portfolio of both personal and professional data projects that I've completed.

In my spare time I can probably be found cycling, bouldering or making my way up a mountain...
