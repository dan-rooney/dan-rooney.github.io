Hi I'm Dan, a data analyst with a background in computational chemistry and 3 years' experience in the financial services industry, during which time I have worked on 

This website serves as a portfolio of both personal and professional data projects that I've completed.

In my spare time I can probably be found cycling, bouldering or making my way up a mountain...
