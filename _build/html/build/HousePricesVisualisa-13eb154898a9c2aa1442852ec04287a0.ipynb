    "# House Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involved building an interactive web app, using Shiny for Python, to display house prices in England and Wales, adding a Choropleth layer to visualise the differences by region. The aim was to demonstrate the Shiny software and investigate trends in house prices over time and across different regions of England and Wales. This notebook contains is analysis into the data and a walkthrough of how the app was built, but if you'd just like to view the app then use this link:\n",

    "##### About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I used the Price Paid Data published monthly by the UK government, which tracks property sales in England and Wales submitted to HM Land Registry for registration. The dataset contains single residential properties sold for value since 1995, and since 2013 includes transfers under power of sale/repossessions, buy-to-lets (where identifiable by Mortgage type) and transfers to non-private individuals. This data is also used by property websites such as Zoopla and Rightmove to allow users to track property prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Price Paid Data includes information on all residential property sales in England and Wales that are sold for value and are lodged with us for registration. It excludes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sales that have not been lodged with HM Land Registry\n",
    "- sales that were not for value\n",
    "- transfers, conveyances, assignments or leases at a premium with nominal rent, which are:\n",
    "- ‘Right to buy’ sales at a discount\n",
    "- subject to an existing mortgage\n",
    "- to effect the sale of a share in a property, for example, a transfer between parties on divorce\n",
    "- by way of a gift\n",
    "- under a compulsory purchase order\n",
    "- under a court order\n",
    "- to Trustees appointed under Deed of appointment\n",
    "- Vesting Deeds Transmissions or Assents of more than one property\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initial planning\n",
    "\n",
    "- What granularity to use? e.g. county, town, postcode\n",
    "    - The dataset contains the postcode of each property, and every postcode has a clearly defined area, which should be available online\n",
    "    - The whole postcode is likely too granular - using the area code or district code should be a good compromise\n",
    "- How to aggregate price paid by area?\n",
    "    - Min, Max, Median, Mean\n",
    "    - Allow user to choose which statistic to show on the map\n",
    "    - Could also compare these summary statistics between points in time, which would highlight the areas which have seen the greatest changes in price over time\n",
