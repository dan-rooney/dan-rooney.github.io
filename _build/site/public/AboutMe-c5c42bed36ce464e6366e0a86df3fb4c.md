title: About Me
---

Hi I'm Dan, a data analyst with a background in computational chemistry and 3 years' experience in the financial services industry. During this time I have worked on many different data projects, varying from ETL and dashboard reporting to machine learning and statistical analysis, meaning I am well versed in the data pipeline from start to finish.

This website serves as a portfolio of both personal and professional data projects that I've completed.

If you'd like to contact me then please use the links in the top right of the page.

In my spare time I can probably be found cycling, bouldering or making my way up a mountain...
