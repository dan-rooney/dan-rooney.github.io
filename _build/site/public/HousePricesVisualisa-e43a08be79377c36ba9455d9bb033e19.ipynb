    "# House Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project was to build an interactive web app for display house prices in England and Wales, using a heat-map overlay to visualise the differences by region.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initial questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- What granularity to show average price at? e.g. county, town, postcode, council?\n",
    "- Could add feature for user to zoom in e.g. initially show at county level, then zoom into postcode level\n",
    "- Mean or median average price? - allow user to choose, outliers will be interesting as well\n",
    "- Might be interesting to see range of house prices by area too\n",
    "    - Min, Max\n",
    "    - Mean\n",
    "    - 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "A next step would be to see how house prices have changed over time. This could be a separate overlay on the map (user chooses which overlay to view), effectively a different page on the website. Challenge will be how to visualise this change over time by area?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How far back in time will data go?\n",
    "- Maybe take snapshots of average price by area every 5 or 10 years\n",
    "- One simple view would be to allow user to select a date range, e.g. 1960-2020, then visual show average price difference between the 2 dates\n",
    "    - Allowing this to be controlled with a slider would make it easier to find trends\n",
    "\n",
