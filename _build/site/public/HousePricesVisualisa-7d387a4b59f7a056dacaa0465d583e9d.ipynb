    "# House Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project was to build an interactive web app for display house prices in England and Wales, using a heat-map overlay to visualise the differences by region.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initial questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- What granularity to show average price at? e.g. county, town, postcode, council?\n",
    "- Could add feature for user to zoom in e.g. initially show at county level, then zoom into postcode level\n",
    "- Mean or median average price? - allow user to choose, outliers will be interesting as well\n",
    "- Might be interesting to see range of house prices by area too\n",
    "    - Min, Max\n",
    "    - Mean\n",
    "    - 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "A next step would be to see how house prices have changed over time. This could be a separate overlay on the map (user chooses which overlay to view), effectively a different page on the website. Challenge will be how to visualise this change over time by area?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How far back in time will data go?\n",
    "- Maybe take snapshots of average price by area every 5 or 10 years\n",
    "- One simple view would be to allow user to select a date range, e.g. 1960-2020, then visual show average price difference between the 2 dates\n",
    "    - Allowing this to be controlled with a slider would make it easier to find trends\n",
    "\n",

    "I had originally planned to use the full dataset in my Shiny app, however the full table is ~5GB in size with ~29m rows. I chose to get around this by sampling the dataset. Taking a simple random sample of the data would mean that the number of samples from each area would be proportional to the population of that area, so to ensure that each area had an equal number of samples I would use stratified sampling instead.\n",

For example, in the postcode PO16 7GZ, PO16 is the outward code (or outcode), PO is the area and 16 is the district.\n",
